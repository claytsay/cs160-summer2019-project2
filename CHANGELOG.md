# Changelog
A log of changes. I hope the title is self-explanatory.

## Version 0.1.0
Some basic framework changes.
- Added placeholder buttons
  - Paint colour selection
  - Undo (`#btn-undo`) and redo (`#btn-redo`)
    - Utilised emoji for the arrows&mdash;perhaps a bad idea
- Began setting up layout of palette
  - Added very rough palette graphic
